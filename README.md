First steps into data analysis with Jupyter

# Installing python
The python distribution we will use is Anaconda, available for free for non-commercial use at this link:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

The advantage of Anaconda is that it comes bundled up with the most popular datascience modules of python like pandas, numpy and many more. Otherwise all of these would need to installed separately.

If your are having trouble installing Anaconda, read the docs ! https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

# Launching Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is the interface we will use for data analysis. Often referred to as a notebook, it is very easy to use and great to learn python or explore messy data. The best practice for a notebook is trial and error, break and repair. A messy but intuetive way to learn. Just remember to cleen it up before you close it down, lest you will hate your past self!

## Create a folder
Create work folder where you want to store your data and jupyter notebook. A best practice is to avoid spaces (use underscore _ ) and spectial characters like -, . or é in the folder and file names in general. To get started, we can download some sample data in the .csv format form https://www.gapminder.org/data/. I will use the average number of [babies per woman](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd008/).

In your work folder, creat a folder named "data" and add the dara file from gapminder into it.

## 3, 2, 1... Launch
Launching jupyter is incredibly easy, follow these few steps:
1. copy the link to your work directory. (on Windows, simply select the path in the folder seach bar)
2. search for "anaconda" in the application search bar and start "Anaconda Prompt"
3. in the anaconda comand window tpye `cd "path\to\my\directory"`
4. hit enter, the active path should now be to your python work directory
5. type `jupyter notebook` hit enter, voilà

A browser window opens, don't panic, it's the jupyter notebook interface. It is not online, but it runs in your browser. You should see the contents of your folder.

To create a new jupyter notebook click `new` and `Python 3`

up right rename......................

# Basic coding with pandas

All the questions on how to do anything with pandas is here https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html, or a short google search "open excel file pandas" away... It's one of the most used libraries so go ahead and search away, you will never be the first to ask.
